    <p>
      After winning 1st place in the 2024 Honors Competition, I was invited to present my project at the 2025 Upper Midwest Honors Conference (UMHC) in Minneapolis. This phase of the project highlighted my journey building an accessible website for visually impaired users and the broader impact it had on my growth as a student leader and community advocate.

                <p>
                  I participated in the NACA Student Government Institute held at Marian University, Indiana, with fellow senators and our VP. The experience not only helped strengthen our team but also gave me insight into how other student governments function across the U.S. I learned about leadership, advocacy, and ways to support international students better.

                    <h2>I Am Your Senator</h2>
                    <p>
                      This campaign was born at the NACA Student Government Institute. The idea was to help students recognize and connect with their senators through personalized flyers that included photos and QR codes. These QR codes linked to senators’ blogs, Senate pages, or emails, lowering barriers to communication and making feedback easier. The project was later adopted by the Public Relations Committee and Executive Council, becoming a permanent initiative for all senators.

      <h2>AI Agent Assistant (Telegram + OpenAI)</h2>
      <p>
        I built a beginner-level personal AI assistant connected to OpenAI (4o mini via API) and deployed through Telegram. 
        It supports both text and voice inputs (with transcription), and can perform basic productivity actions using Gmail and Google Calendar integrations with simple memory.
