                <h2>Statewide Advocacy and Student Priorities</h2>

                <p>
                    This project documents my participation in a Wisconsin Student Government (WSG) meeting where student representatives collaborated on statewide priorities that impact technical college communities across Wisconsin.
                    The meeting focused on identifying what students need most and turning those needs into actionable priorities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A major theme of our discussions was how to make Wisconsin more international-student-friendly.
                    We shared perspectives on barriers international students face and highlighted the value international students bring to campus life, academic excellence, and the state economy.
                    I contributed to conversations centered on inclusion, access, and practical support structures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We also worked to prioritize initiatives related to <strong>mental health</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and student success.
                    In addition, we discussed broader system-level topics such as transfer pathways and academic accessibility so that more students can progress efficiently from two-year programs into four-year opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This experience strengthened my leadership and policy-awareness skills by placing advocacy into a real working environment where ideas must be organized, communicated clearly, and aligned with shared goals.
                    It also reinforced my commitment to equity-centered education and to building systems where more students can thrive.
