            <h2>365 Leadership Summit (Madison)</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>365 Leadership Summit</strong> is a professional leadership event I attended in Madison to learn practical leadership and community engagement strategies.
                I had the opportunity to participate through support from my <strong>IETC office</strong>, which helped me join the summit as part of my growth as a student leader.
            </p>
            <p>
                The summit focused on leadership in action: communication, collaboration, and showing up consistently for your community.
                It also provided a strong space for networking with people from different backgrounds who are working in public service, education, and student leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest takeaways for me was how leadership is not just a title.
                It is a set of habits: listening first, asking better questions, and building trust through follow-through.
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience helped me reflect on my own leadership work at Madison College and how I can better support students, especially international students, through clearer communication and stronger advocacy.
