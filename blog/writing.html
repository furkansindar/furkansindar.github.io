            <h2>My Relationship with Writing</h2>

            <p>My relationship with writing has been good since childhood. Everything started with a class competition. The goal was to write the best story, and I came up with the idea of an orphan knight who falls in love with the princess of the country. But before he could marry her and become a king, the king gave him missions to prove himself. These missions were not easy. He had to train a dragon and fight dangerous beasts.</p>

            <p>At that time, I was already passionate about reading fantasy books, so creating my own fantasy world made me really happy. Unfortunately, my teacher didn’t like it. Maybe he wasn’t into fantasy. Maybe he was more of a Star Wars fan. I didn’t get a good grade that day, but something more valuable started: my passion for writing.</p>

            <p>After that, I began writing stories for Dungeons and Dragons and other role-play setups. It was really beneficial because now I’m writing opinion-based articles and working as a reporter for my school newspaper.</p>

            <p>What I like most about writing is the feeling of freedom. I can express all my thoughts without being interrupted or making anyone annoyed. I love sharing my thoughts with people, but when I try to do it while speaking, I sometimes talk too much or make people tired. Writing gives me a space where I can express myself without limits.</p>

            <p>The only difficulty I face with writing is that English is my second language. Sometimes I struggle to find the right words to express myself, and I need to use a dictionary or search online. It takes time, but as long as I learn to express my thoughts with strong words, I will appreciate every minute I spend improving.</p>
