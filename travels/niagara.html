            <h2>Niagara Falls Detour</h2>
            <p>
                Our original plan was a road trip from Wisconsin to New York, but then we realized Niagara Falls was just a few hours out of the way. With only a 3-hour detour, we could explore one of nature’s most iconic wonders — and that’s exactly what we did!
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey became what we jokingly called "New York Road Trip: Part I." We set off with our playlists, podcasts, and endless conversation topics ready to go. As we drove, we noticed Google Maps was routing us through Canada — a twist that led us to adjust our path. That added time, but also gave us the chance to explore Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pennsylvania stood out with its lush nature and reminded me so much of Wisconsin. One quirky highlight? Buying slippers at a store and noticing they didn’t charge tax — a small but welcome surprise!
            </p>

                Finally arriving at Niagara was surreal. Just across the river was Canada, with its buildings and people in clear view. Although I was tempted, crossing the border wasn’t in our plans. Instead, we soaked in the sight of this massive waterfall that literally stands between two nations.
            </p>
            <p>
                After admiring the falls from above, we bought tickets for the iconic boat ride. Everyone on the U.S. side wore blue ponchos, while we noticed those on the Canadian boat wore pink — a fun detail I loved. As our boat approached the center of the falls, the mist thickened, and soon we couldn’t see more than a few feet ahead. The water poured from all directions — it felt like nature itself was giving us a shower.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just before we disembarked, we passed another boat carrying pink-clad Canadians heading toward the falls. They waved and shouted, and of course, we did the same — sending them off with encouragement and energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the tour, we dried off, rested briefly, and hit the road once again — destination: New York City. But Niagara left us soaked in excitement and unforgettable memories.
