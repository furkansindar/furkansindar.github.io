            <h2>Our Halloween Costume Adventure</h2>

            <p>
                This was my third Halloween in the U.S., and I finally felt ready to join the tradition by wearing a costume. When I shared the idea with my friends, they were just as excited. So we headed straight to a costume store and started planning.
            </p>

            <p>
                My best friend and I decided to be a team: I’d be Mario and he would be Luigi. And of course, my girlfriend became Princess Peach! It was the perfect trio — but something was missing. We needed a villain.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s when I looked at our dog, Wynter, and got the best idea. What if he dressed up as Pennywise from the movie *IT*? But instead of scaring people, his cuteness totally disarmed them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Without wasting any time, we hit the road to Madison. The night turned out to be fun, colorful, and full of laughter. We even joined a costume contest! Although we didn’t win, it was a truly awesome experience.
